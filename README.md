# DailyUploadChallenge

Project Name:
  Daily Upload Challenge

Project Description:
  The idea behind this is to submit code daily to improve skill and keep a steady coding rhythm.

Rules:
  1. Submit once a day at least
  2. Code can be anything as long as it works or is intended to work (WIP optional for larger projects).
  3. Code can be in any language.
  4. This is a learning exercise so once the final idea is "Closed" there will be no refactoring
  5. Keep good documentation, naming conventions, and organization when possible 
  6. Don't take it too seriously
